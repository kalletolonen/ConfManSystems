The purpose of this article is to show the process and method of creating a Salt State for a development server for Django.

The current maturity state is at "hello world" in the finished repo.

Requirements for using the state:
Debian 11
Salt-minion installed

You'll be able to apply the project on your own development server by copying the contents or the finished state to **/srv/salt/djangoadmin** and then running the command:
		
	salt-state --local state.apply djangoadmin
