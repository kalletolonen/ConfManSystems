# **h3 Versionhallinta / Managing versions**

I started @ 12.02.
  
The source for the exercise [h3](https://terokarvinen.com/2021/configuration-management-systems-2022-spring/#h3-versionhallinta)
  
**Hardware & Software**  
*Win 11 + VirtualBox 6.0 + Debian 11 Bullseye*  
  
*Hardware:*  
*CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS*  
*Mem: 16 Gt LPDDR4X*  
*Storage: 512 Gt M.2 2230 NVMe PCIe 3.0 SSD*  
  
##  z) Lue ja tiivistä / Reading exercise  
  
** https://commonmark.org/help/ **  
  
The article tell the gospel of .md. It's a really simple way of doing word processing. It does only some basic stuff, but the key function of text isn't to look extra fance - it's to convey information. In that regard, MarkDown is the alpha of alpha's on the field. You can create links, headings, show images, quote code **with intendations intact** and get stuff done extremely quickly.  
  
Key takeaway for me:  
-You can highlight code by putting it between backticks: \```  code goes here \```  
  
**Example**  
  
```
import random
print(random.randint(1,10))
```
  

## a) MarkDown. Tee tämän tehtävän raportti MarkDownina. Helpointa on tehdä raportti GitHub-varastoon, jolloin md-päätteiset tiedostot muotoillaan automaattisesti. Tyhjä rivi tekee kappalejaon, risuaita ‘#’ tekee otsikon, sisennys merkitsee koodinpätkän. / Do the report in MarkDown.

This report was written in MarkDown, with notepad++, that has natice support for the format. Notepad++ makes the formatting obvious even when you're writing your text - you can easily notice when you do a typo from the UI.  
  
![Pic 1. Notepad++](pics/h3/1.png)  
*Native support for the md-syntax*  
  
## b) Pull first. Tee useita muutoksia git-varastoosi. Tee muutama muutos, jossa yksi commit koskee useampaa tiedostoa. Anna hyvä kuvaukset (commit message), yksi englanninkielinen lause imperatiivissa (määräysmuodossa) "Add top level menu to Foobar synchronizer" / Use Git properly
  
First I added this article to my course repository. My repository already existed, so I didn't have to initiate it. These commands were given in the directory that this article was in.   
	
	git pull
	git push
	git add .
	git commit -m "Made initial commit for article"
	git pull
	git push

As it is obvious from the CLI, Git works with Windows too.

*Going meta - rendered MarkDown in Github*  

## c) Kaikki kirjataan. Näytä omalla git-varastollasi esimerkit komennoista ‘git log’, ‘git diff’ ja ‘git blame’. Selitä tulokset. / Explain the output from Git-commands

I continued this article in my Virtualbox-Linux and Micro. Here's a tip to make MarkDown readable in Micro:  

	Push ctrl + e #for Micro settings
	set softwrap true

This is a handy way to make text wrap so that it fits smaller screen sizes.

Next, I made a pull and a push.

	git pull
	git push

Then I executed the log-command.

	git log

Finally, it was time to find the blame.  

	git blame

Git blame will show you who did what:

Just to be sure, I ran diff again.

Käytä tarvittaessa ‘find -printf “%T+ %p\n”|sort’ löytääksesi uudet asetustiedostot. / Make a new state with Salt

I started by making a list of software and settings I would like to have for studying and work:  
	Micro
	bash-completion
	Git
	Gimp
	Blender
	Python3
	Ufw
	Apache2
	Ssh
	Pwgen

My preferred settings:

	Micro - softwrap = True, tabstospaces = False
	Sudoedit = Micro
	
### Micro

It seems to me that Micro only saves values for settings that are true, ie. it propably presumes that everything else is false. The settings are stored in:

	/home/user/.config/micro/settings.json

So, my first state was going to be installing Micro and making the settings I liked best. I used my previous article as [a source](https://github.com/kalletolonen/ConfManSystems/blob/main/h2.md).  

	sudo mkdir /srv/salt/desktop
	sudoedit /srv/salt/desktop/init.sls

````
micro:
	pkg.installed
````
	
	sudo salt-call --local state.apply desktop

````
[CRITICAL] Rendering SLS 'base:desktop' failed: found character that cannot start any token
local:
    Data failed to compile:
----------
    Rendering SLS 'base:desktop' failed: found character that cannot start any token
````

As a result I had a bizarre error message. Just putting the error message to Google told me that YAML was to blame and I realized that I might have just used a tab instead of spaces when writing the state. I fixed my state to have only spaces as intendations.

	sudoedit /srv/salt/desktop/init.sls
	sudo salt-call --local state.apply desktop

````
micro:
  pkg.installed
````

````

That was more like it. Next it was time to add the settings I wanted in Micro.  

	sudo cp .config/micro/settings.json /srv/salt/desktop/
	#I was in my home directory for this, thus no absolute path
	sudoedit /srv/salt/desktop/init.sls

````

It was quite obvious that I had left a wrong path in my state. I changed it to match the real location of my config file and executed the state again.

	sudoedit /srv/salt/desktop/init.sls

````
micro:
  pkg.installed

There wasn't a difference in errors, so I checked the location and contents of my settings.json. And I did realize, that I had the wrong location, since my state was "desktop" and not "micro".  
	sudoedit /srv/salt/desktop/init.sls

micro:
  pkg.installed

The new printout suggested that I had made some progress. This state will be made better in the future when we will learn about using variables in Salt states, now it will only work properly if I'm logged in as the user "kallet", since the path to Micro's settings is absolute.  

Just as I was thinking about this - I think a good way to implement this sort of "my own computer on any machine"-type of thinking would be a live-usb with Linux and thus negate the need for a spesific user.  

### Bash-completion

This was just another pkg, so I added 2 lines of code and ran the state to make sure I hadn't made any typos.  

	sudoedit /srv/salt/desktop/init.sls

````
micro:
  pkg.installed

/home/kallet/.config/micro/settings.json:
  file.managed:
    - source: salt://desktop/settings.json

bash-completion:
  pkg.installed
````
	
	sudo salt-call --local state.apply desktop

 ````
 Summary for local
 ------------
 Succeeded: 3

 ````

 Now I decided to make a little test, and I removed bash-completion and micro.

 	sudo apt-get purge micro bash-completion

````
bash: micro: command not found
````

Also, hitting the tab still did complete bash command  in the cli after I restarted the terminal, so I executed my state just to see would it imply changes.

	sudo salt-call --local state.apply desktop

My guess on whyh bash-completion still continued to work was that I had multiple terminals open and the process was still running and thus it never stopped working.  

I took a break @ 15.45 and made a commit.
